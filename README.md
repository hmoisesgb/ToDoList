# Overview

This is a To-Do List console based program. This program allows the user to add, delete, view, and mark tasks as completed. Each task has a description and also a completition value to show if it has been completed or not.

I did this program to understand the basics of C++, and to demonstrate how to use Visual Studio to create a console based application using C++.
